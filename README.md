# CS747-Assignments
My solutions to the programming assignments uploaded on https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/teaching/old/cs747-a2020/. Reports + Code are included.

Short descriptions of the Assignments:

## Assignment 1
Comparison of different algorithms for regret minimization in multi-armed bandits under a bernoulli distribution. Algorithms implemented are epsilon-greedy, Thompson sampling, UCB, KL-UCB. A variant of Thompson sampling when given a permutation of actual arm parameters is also explored.

## Assignment 2
Computing optimal policy and value functions for MDPs. Algorithms implemented are Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, Linear Programming. An application to the shortest path is implemented (by modelling a shortest path problem as an MDP and using the policy to find the shortest path).

## Assignment 3
Implementation of 3 control algorithms - Q-learning, Sarsa, and Expected Sarsa. The "Windy Gridworld" task from Sutton and Barto, Example 6.5 is implemented as an application.
